# 🧩 Digit Recognition with ZenML & SVC

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my project where I use ZenML and an SVC model to recognize handwritten digits. 🖊️🧠

## 🚀 What’s in This Repo?

- **ZenML Pipeline**: A cool pipeline that handles everything from data loading to model training and visualization.
- **Custom SVC Classifier**: A custom SVC model for classifying those digits. 📈
- **Visualization**: See how well your model is doing with some awesome plots and confusion matrices. 📊

## 🛠️ How to Get Started

1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have all the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up ZenML**:
   Initialize ZenML and start the dashboard:
   ```bash
   !zenml init
   ```

4. **Run the Pipeline**:
   Start the digit recognition pipeline:
   ```python
   from your_pipeline_module import digit_recognition_pipeline
   digits_svc_pipeline = digit_recognition_pipeline()
   digits_svc_pipeline.run()
   ```

5. **Access the Dashboard**:
   - If you’re in Google Colab, the dashboard will be available via a public URL. 🌐
   - For local setups, you can access it directly on [http://localhost:8237](http://localhost:8237).

## 🖼️ What You’ll See

- **Sample Predictions**: A few digits with their true and predicted labels.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A heatmap showing how well the model is performing across different digits.

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

- Make sure to check the ZenML dashboard to see your pipeline in action!
- Play around with the SVC parameters to see how they affect performance.
